      Technology may be my profession, but endurance sports — especially marathon running — have shaped how I think about
      discipline, resilience, and long-term performance.

          <h2>The Marathon Mindset</h2>

          <p>
            I’ve been running marathons since <strong>2003</strong> and have completed about <strong>15 marathons</strong> to date —
            along with numerous <strong>10Ks</strong> and <strong>5Ks</strong>. Endurance has become more than a sport for me; it’s a mindset.
          </p>

          <p>
            Marathon training teaches patience, structure, and consistency. You don’t get results from one great workout —
            you get them from showing up again and again with a long-term mindset. That same philosophy drives how I help
            organizations adopt AI and improve security operations: progress through repeatable systems, not one-off bursts.
          </p>

          <p>
            Running has reinforced the importance of pacing, recovery, and adaptability — lessons that apply just as much
            to complex cloud systems and security programs as they do to the road.
          </p>

        I’m deeply grateful for my family — my strongest fans and supporters. They’ve encouraged me through early mornings,
        tough training cycles, and the discipline it takes to keep showing up year after year.

        Their support is a reminder that endurance is never only physical — it’s emotional, relational, and spiritual.
        Behind every finish line is a community that helped make it possible.

      <p class="lead">
        What marathon training teaches us about sustainable performance, pressure, and long-term success.
      </p>

      <p>
        In endurance sports, results don’t come from one great day — they come from consistency, pacing, and
        resilience through setbacks. The same principles apply to demanding careers, leadership roles, and
        high-pressure environments.
      </p>

      <p>
        This keynote translates lessons from marathon running into a practical framework for building
        resilience at work and in life — without burnout, guilt cycles, or unsustainable intensity.
      </p>

      <h3>Key Themes</h3>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Consistency beats intensity</li>
        <li>Pacing as a performance strategy</li>
        <li>Recovery as a competitive advantage</li>
        <li>Resetting quickly after setbacks</li>
        <li>Building identity around finishing, not perfection</li>
